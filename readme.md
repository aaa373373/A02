**Git Tutorial**
**Git is a version control system, which is used to work together on code and helps developers keep track of code changes. Initializing Git on a folder involves creating a repository, which results in the group of a hidden folder to track changes within that directory. When a file undergoes modification, addition, or deletion, it is considered as "modified." Users then select specific modified files to be performed. The performed files are committed, prompting Git to store a snapshot of the selected files. Git provides the ability to view the complete history of every commit, allowing users to return to any previous commit. It's important to note that Git does not store separate copies of every file in each commit but rather tracks the changes made in each commit.**

**GitHub Tutorial**
**GitHub serves as a platform hosting Git repositories, offering developers tools for efficient code teamwork through features such as command line pull requests, and code review. The GitHub Marketplace provides a variety of free and paid apps to improve development workflows. With the GitHub flow, work is organized into repositories, allowing developers to easily outline requirements, set expectations, and collaborate. Developers create branches to work on updates, commit changes, open pull requests for discussion, and merge them once a consensus is reached. GitHub's community of 100 million developers and extensive ecosystem of integrations contribute to transforming the software development process.**

**PART 1: Directions on Using WebStorm**
**WebStorm, established by JetBrains, is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed for JavaScript and TypeScript development. It provides a complete set of tools, allowing developers to start coding well. WebStorm makes things easier for complex tasks, such as solving Git merge conflicts or renaming symbols across many files, making these processes easily manageable with just a few clicks.**

**a. To open a project: On the Welcome Screen, click Open and then select the folder with your application in the dialog that opens.**

**b. To check out a project from a version control system**
**1. Click Get from VCS on the Welcome screen.**
**Alternatively, select File | New | Project from Version Control or Git | Clone… or VCS | Get from Version Control from the main menu.**
**Instead of Git in the main menu, you may see any other Version Control System that is associated with your project. For example, Mercurial or Perforce.**
**2. In the dialog that opens, select your version control system from the list and specify the repository to check out the application sources. For more information, refer to Check out a project (clone).**

**c. To create an empty WebStorm project**
**1. Click Create New Project on the Welcome screen or select File | New | Project from the main menu. The New Project dialog opens.**
**2. In the left-hand pane, choose Empty Project. In the right-hand pane, specify the application folder and click Create.**
**You can also generate a project from a template. For more information, refer to Generating framework-specific projects.**

**d. To create a new file in a project**
**1. In the Project tool window, select the folder where you want to create a new file and press AltInsert.**
**2. Alternatively, choose New from the context menu of the selection and then choose the file type from the list.**

**Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list**

** Branch - shows the branches being worked on locally.**
** Clone - creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project's files, history, and branches.**

** Commit - saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process.**

** Fetch - Fetching a branch means getting the branch’s head’s ref from a remote repository, to find out which items are missing from the local object database, and getting them.**
** GIT - Git allows developers to see the timeline of their changes, decisions, and progression of any project in one place.**
** GitHub - GitHub hosts Git repositories and provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded discussions), pull requests, and code reviews.**

** Merge - combines lines of development. It is used to combine changes made on two different branches.**

** Merge Conflict – Merge conflicts are when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to add in in the final merge.**

** Pull - updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart.**

** Push - updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.**

** Remote – A remote is a Git repository hosted on the internet or some other network.**

** Repository - encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file's revision history.**
